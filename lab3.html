									<p>This lab we again split into 2 groups. Group 1 worked on radio and GUI implementation whie Group 2 integrated more functionality into LABron's maze exploring skills, including starting on a 660 Hz sound and encoding LABron's surroundings. Group 1 was Shubhom and David. Group 2 was Rohan and Ho-Jung. Below is a summary of the steps needed to advance LABron through yet another preliminary challenge before he enters the arena at Nationals (held in December).</p>

												<h3>Group 1: Setting Up Radios</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The radios we used for this part of lab were the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/2.4GHz-RF/nRF24L01P">Nordic nRF24L01+ transceivers</a>. We need 2 of these radios to setup on LABron (to communicate information about the maze) and on a second Arduino Uno which will be setting up our base-station and receiving information from LABron. Communication between the two radios is relatively straight-forward, requiring us to only setup our identifier channel (70 and 71 for Team 23) and modifying existing sketches for inter-radio communication. Integrating this into LABron, we decided that the radio communcation should only happen at intersections (when new information was present), and should contain various information about position/walls/treasures. The decision for encoding this information was left up to Group 2 while Group 1 forged ahead to work with the GUI.</p>

											<h3>Setting up a GUI Interface </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
													The next step after enabling radio communication was to
													link the base-station's serial communication packets with the provided GUI 
													using provided APIs. First, to test the GUI functionality, we hard-coded
													a maze, meaning we created an array and defined wall locations that could be fed as
													a packet to be decoded and rendered by the GUI. This relied on the encoding scheme Group 2
													defined (see below), and ended up being successful (pictured right).

										<h2>Group 2: Mapping the Maze</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									One of the challenges of the lab was maintaining information about
									a 9 x 9 map of intersections. To maintain this information, we created a 9 x 9 byte array where each entry contained a byte with encoded information about the
									walls and treasures near that intersection. Specifically, the 8 bit "metapackets" were encoded
									as follows: <br><br>

									Bit 0: Wall West<br>
									Bit 1: Wall North<br>
									Bit 2: Wall East<br>
									Bit 3: Wall South<br>
									Bit 4: Treasure Shape<br>
									Bit 5: Treasure Shape<br>
									Bit 6: Treasure Color<br>
									Bit 7: Treasure Color<br><br>

									Note that these directions are all absolute. These metadata incorporating packets
									were intended to use absolute directions so that some logic was written to track
									LABron's absolute direction on the map and translate motion when direction changes were made
									to the cardinal directions, which occurred at intersections (the desired functionality
									for IR hat detection was to stop). Furthermore, two global state variables representing LABron's
									current coordinate were created and updated at each intersection. Then, at each intersection,
									one packets of size two bytes was sent from the onboard radio to the base station: the first byte was
									 the (x,y) coordinate	where x and y were each encoded as 4 bits, and the last 8 bits contained the
									 8 bit "metapacket" that was contained in the local map at that (x,y) intersection.

											<p>Once we'd taken care of the bulk of the new material due for this lab, we went back and began working on integrating already functioning components into the behavior of our robot.

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
							This was LABron's most challenging lab to date. After full integration from Milestone 2, including
							beginning at the start whistle and adding radio
							capabilities for wireless transmission, LABron had to begin
							navigating the maze and storing not only his
							own state but also all information he had about the maze, and
							transmitting this remotely. Some of the challenges
							faced in this lab included getting the radio communication to
							work as intended, as radios were easily prone to
							damage from mistakes in power supplied or previous usage.
							Furthermore, integrating the full array of sensors and
							program logic required more careful consideration of data types and data structures
							used. Two future plans for improving LABron are the incorporation of interrupt-driven
							logical decisions as well and the writing of more memory-efficient code/algorithms,
							as current implementations require over 90% of system memory.
