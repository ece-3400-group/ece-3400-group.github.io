										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In Lab 1, we were able to assemble a
										functioning robot named LeBron that was able 
										to be given a simple script and 
										run autonomously. In this next 
										phase, we implemented line 
										detection sensors so that LeBron
										could take some guidance from it
										surroundings and use that to 
										direct its movement. Finally, we used 
									our line detection functionality to implement a simple
									Figure 8. </p>

												<h3>Converting Data to Decision</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After we were able to accurately 
												detect the line and background, 
												we attached 3 sensors to the front
												of our robot to detect where the 
												robot was relative to the line.
												When the middle sensor was activated,
												LeBron was directly above the 
												line. When the left sensor was 
												activated, LeBron was given
												a command to adjust left; the 
												same logic was used when the 
												robot's right sensor was 
												activated. In this way, LeBron was able to 
												know its position relative to the line at all times.

												<h3>Tackling Turns</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The implemented code up to this point
												allows our robot to trace a line. 
												However, a major hurdle to
												completing a figure-8 is turning 
												the robot from one line onto 
												another line. Travelling to these
												intersections is relatively 
												straightforward using the 
												outline defined above, but 
												adding complexity to trace 
												intersections requires additional 
												testing of our robot. First, 
												we notice that as we reach an 
												intersection, all of our IR 
												sensors detect a line underneath 
												them. This gives us a good 
												indicator that we're approaching
												an intersection and lets us 
												finish travelling to the 
												intersection before we begin 
												a 90 degree turn. The turn 
												itself is relatively straight
												forward as well, turning our 
												wheels in opposite directions or 
												rotating one wheel and pivoting on
												the other. Therefore, at intersections, LeBron is able
												to make accurate turns.

												<h3>Figure 8 Tracking</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Milestone is almost accomplished now.
												We are able to direct our robot to
												trace lines and make accurate turns.
												The only piece left is directing our
												robot through a series of turns to
												trace out a figure 8. To accomplish 
												this, we defined right and left 
												turns corresponding to a variable 
												which kept track of executed turns
												up until that point. To check out 
												the implementation of the various
												parts of this Milestone and try it
												yourself, download our code below!

										<h2>Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Previously, we learned to use an Arduino Uno to 
										operate servos, giving our robot some level 
										of autonomous movement. However, the decisions
										for which servo was activated when had been 
										determined by pre-written code. In this milestone, 
										we made the decision for activating servos 
										dependent on our robots environment. IR sensors 
										tracked lines of tape and our robot was able to 
										respond by tracing the path of that tape, even 
										around turns. This culminated in our robot 
										autonomously tracing a figure-8 pattern.</p>
									<h3>Thoughts</h3>
									<p>The current implementation of turning and path
										correction uses the Arduino <code>delay()</code>
										function throughout it. This isn't the most
										rigorous setup, as a discharged battery might 
										affect the wheels speeds of our servos and change
										the distance our robot travels during those delays.
										Additionally, in the videos posted above, our robot 
										stuttered throughout its tracking. This was a 
										result of a poorly attached bearing. Since this 
										filming, we've made adjustments to make sure 
										our bearing is tightly attached at the robot 
										has its sensors above the ground constantly, 
										instead of bouncing back and forth, resulting in smoother operation.
									Furthermore, we changed our turn logic to be less reliant on timed delays. Instead, 
									the outer sensors detect when a turn is happening and Lebron continues the wheel motion
									until the outer sensor in question returns to a white line. In other words, the sensor detects when a
									sweep is begun and complete, allowing LeBron to turn and follow lines not necessarily at right angles.
