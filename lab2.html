										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In this lab we built out our robots sensors to include photodiodes and a microphone. The goal of Lab 2 was for our robot to be able to respond to a 660Hz whistle and separately detect both a 6.08 kHz and 18 kHz IR signal emitted from treasures and other robots respectively. To accomplish this, we split into two groups, an Acoustic Team and an IR Team. The Acoustic Team was composed of Ho-Jung and David. The IR Team was composed of Rohan and Shubhom. Below we detail the methodology by which we accomplished these tasks.</p>

										<h4>Fast Fourier Transform Library</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										The purpose of the Open Music Labs Arduino FFT package is to quickly identify the frequency of inputs to the Arduino. Ideally, analog
										 filters we create will be able to filter out undesirable
										  signals (decoys and ambient noise), allowing a software solution
											 to detect favorable signals (such as treasures). In the Fourier transform, the frequency of received signals will have a
												significantly higher amplitude than other ones,
												 making detection of treasures and start signals simple.
												  As a result, the FFT is a convenient way to sample
													 frequencies in a way that can be interpreted in the
													  Arduino software.

												<h3>Beginning to Sense IR</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We were able to begin sensing IR light with a very simple setup. We place our Vout node connected to a pulldown resistor, separated from Vdd by the phototransistor sensor. This design rests at 0V in the absence of IR light, and rises as sensed IR light allows current to flow through the circuit and a growing voltage drop is measured across the resistor. Increasing the resistance here would make circuit more sensitive, but for our needs a 2kΩ was enough.</p>

												<h3>Adding Analog Filtering and Gain</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The rationale behind this decision was relatively straightforward. The signal we were picking up off our IR sensor would fall to 0V in the absence of light, but rests very close to 0V when detected IR light isn't very strong as well. Amplifying our sensor output would therefore allow us to see the consistent 6.08 kHz signal we are looking for. However, the 18 kHz signal's proximity in the frequency domain to 6 kHz would result in some saturation of the signal we're searching for. In order to avoid this issue, we implemented a low pass filter with a pole of 12 kHz to reduce the amplitude of the decoy signals and noise our robot would have to parse through. <b>To the left you can view our FFT analysis of a 6kHz signal and 18 kHz signal in bins 20 and 45 respectively. </b></p>

												<h3>Software Interpretation of Signal</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Determining the presence of a 6 kHz signal right now is done using the FFT library. We find that the signal appears in <b>bin/bins XXX</b>. Because we generally see a large amount of environmental IR light, we only accept that a 6 kHz signal is indeed present when the perceived amplitude is approximately 3 times larger than the bins around it.</p>

												<h3>Building the Microphone Circuit</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Before we are able to determine the presence of a 660 Hz signal in the robots environment, we need to wire the microphone sensor correctly and start receiving digital pulses encoding the audio impulses around the cicuit. We referenced Team Alphas design from last year and were very quickly able to begin sampling audio tones digitally. </p>

												<h3>Detecting our Desired Audio Signal</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The next part of this was combining a low pass filter and amplifier to boost the recieved signals and make them more discernable to the FFT. Once this was complete, we were able to view signals through the FFT function of our oscilloscope (pictured to the right).</p>

												<h3>Identifying Signals</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Finally, we were able to use the Arduino FFT Library to begin detecting the 660 Hz signal that we were searching for. From this point, all we have left to do is create an automatic detection algorithm for both audio and IR signals.</p>

									<p>Previously, we were able to determine which FFT bins a signal would fall into within some range of error (eg ± 2 bins). Armed with this knowledge, we were able to create a deteciton algorithm for each of the 3 signals we were using around our robot: a 660 Hz audio signal, a 6.08 Khz IR signal, and an 18 kHz IR signal. Above a detected threshold, we determined that the signal was in fact present in the robots environment. To make it simpler to run the FFT on bother IR and audio circuit outputs, we combined the Amplifer signals using a simple adder circuit and were thus able to analogRead on one port and run the FFT on this data, cutting down on processing by a factor of 2.</p>
